# gbl

gbl (Game Book Language) is a DSL designed to make the process of writing
gamebooks or choose-your-own adventure stories simpler, while also providing a
rich feature set.

Although it is written as a programming language, it should not be too difficult
to pick up the basics, even for someone with no programming experience.
